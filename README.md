# cd-user
cd-user golang RPC conduit to user business logics
Note that the module hosting user business logics is hosted in cd-core (github.com/tcp-x/cd-core/sys/user)
RPC allows user to be accessible in a distributed architecture.
It is this RPC mechanism that allows corpdesk to be extensible and enable pluggability.
